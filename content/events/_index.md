We have started an informal RINGS Student Seminar series for students working on NSF RINGS funded projects (not just ours) to present their work in progress and facilitate discussions between students at different schools.

To get on the mailing list, please send an email to [rings_informal_seminar-subscribe@email.rutgers.edu](mailto:rings_informal_seminar-subscribe@email.rutgers.edu).
