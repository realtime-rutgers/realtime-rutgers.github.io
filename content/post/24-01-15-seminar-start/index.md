We are piloting a "RINGS Informal Seminar" series for students from different RINGS projects working on related topics to present their work in progress. Our first scheduled speaker is Zonghong Liu (Rutgers), who is working on Project [CNS-2148182](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2148182).

For more information, see the [Events tab](https://realtime-rutgers.github.io/event/).

Announcements about talks will be sent to our mailing list. To sign up, send any email to [rings_informal_seminar-subscribe@email.rutgers.edu](rings_informal_seminar-subscribe@email.rutgers.edu).

We are also piloting a Zulip server for discussions. If you are interested in an invitation link, please contact us.
