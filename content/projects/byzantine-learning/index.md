The algorithm we proposed is called BRIDGE: Byzantine ResIlient Decentralized Gradient dEscent. Mobile-egde distributed/decentrazlied communication networks are subject to outage and malfunctioning of devices. We categorize all those failures as Byzantine failures. The algorithm with coordinate-wise trimmed mean screening method was proved theoretically being able to solve the decentralized empircal risk minimization problem with presence of Byzantine failure in the distributed/decentrazlied network with strongly (local strongly) convex loss functions. Also, experimentally the algorithm has been shown to work well with other screening methods, such as coordinate-wise median, krum and bulyan. This work address the major challenge of mobile-egde distributed machine learning problem resilient to failures in the network. Further work includes design and implement algorithms that would deal with non-i.i.d. and general nonconvex objective funtions.
