An increasing amount of attention has been drawn to the area of designing reliable and efficient machine learning algorithms. Due to either design constraints (e.g., multi-agent and Internet-of-Things systems) or computational/privacy reasons (e.g., large-scale machine learning on smartphone data), some of the machine learning applications are typically limited to loss functions that are distributed across multiple computing devices/machines. For those applications, learning tasks usually need to be done in a decentralized fashion, in which a central server directly connecting to all the nodes will not be guaranteed to exist. However, to fulfill the design constraint/satisfy the computational/privacy requirements, especially in real-world decentralized applications, people often need to pay the price of links between nodes being vulnerable to failures due to the quality of communication channels, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc., which are likely to bias the nodes from learning the designated models. The main contribution is to make decentralized optimization robust to such failures in the network.
