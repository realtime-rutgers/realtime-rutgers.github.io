abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of memory sampling in status updating systems, where source updates are published in shared memory, and reader process samples the memory for source updates by paying a sampling cost. We formulate a discrete-time decision problem to find a sampling policy that minimizes average cost comprising age at the client and the cost incurred due to sampling. We establish that an optimal policy is a stationary and deterministic threshold-type policy, and subsequently derive optimal threshold and the corresponding optimal average cost.
