abstract: Next-generation mobile core networks are being designed to support a variety
  of latency sensitive applications based on emerging virtual, augmented or mixed
  reality technologies. A cloud-native approach for 5G core has been proposed to meet
  the diverse service requirements of NextG while reducing both CAPEX and OPEX. In
  this context, microservice architecture for network function virtualization is generally
  considered to be suitable for meeting NextG service requirements. Despite many advantages,
  the cloud-native core raises new challenges in the design of NextG systems for latency
  critical applications. An approach to achieving diverse QoS requirements is proposed
  in this paper. Specifically, the design is based on an orchestrator called the MEC-Intelligent
  Agent (MEC-IA) which enables dynamic compute resource distribution and network slice
  assignment in the core for improved QoS. The MEC-IA framework realizes resource
  management by intelligently assigning UEs to the access and mobility management
  function (AMF) while also performing slice provisioning. Simulation results are
  presented for the proposed MEC-IA framework showing the median control plane delay
  reduced by a factor of 1.67 ×. Further, robustness of the system improves significantly,
  reflecting a better overall user experience since the percentage connection dropped
  at 3 × traffic volume reduces by 1.5 × and slices assignment increases by 1.4 ×
  across all slices, even when the traffic arrival is skewed.
